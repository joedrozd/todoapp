Why are we doing this?
--
To prove our skills and knowledge in Java - software development - SQL databases.

How I expected the challenge to go? What didn't go as planned?
--
I expected it to be more difficult that it ended up being. I got a basic structure built and then it all came together quite well. When I have programmed in the past I either breeze through it or get stuck for hours on small parts. This happened twice at the point of writing this readme. Firstly, I got stuck adding things to the POM file and didn't correctly structure my files and packages. This lead to a not responding application. Once these were fixed, it was easier. The second time, I added a @pathvarible spring argument to a new method and didnt remove it when I changed the way the method worked. Once I realised this the method came together. 

What went well?
--
I think the overall structure and building the base went quite well. I am yet to do testing as of writing this but I hope that goes well too. I really enjoyed Eclipses "handholding" compared to JavaScript programming in VSCode. I am currently building an API anyway so Postman and general API information I have already recently learned and implemented but in JS. I'm planning on building a frontend for the project and have really enjoyed the API building. Git is another thing that went well, I use github desktop for the majority of git implementation and it is wonderful and very user friendly. 

Possible improvements?
--
I discuss what could be added to some of the specific code in my Java source files. 

The main improvements are around actually utilizing the previously discussed @pathvariable for finding specific jobs in the JobsHours method. Another is adding some more intricate and specified Custom exceptions. However, if things go well or appear within the testing I will add a few more custom exceptions. 

I would like to work on the headers part of postman and require and API key to access the API. 

Testing 
--
I really enjoyed testing my app and managed to work my way through every different method and postman request apart from my feature branch. This meant I reached 77%, a little short of the 80% asked for but I'm ok with that. The SystemIntegration tests are not working unless ran separately but I think that is normal and I haven't fully configured the tests to start up independantly each time.
